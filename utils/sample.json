    "DESCRIPTION": "<div>It has come to the attention of Irish Water and Wicklow County Council that recent testing of the public water supply served by Aughrim Annacurra PWS (3400PUB1023) indicates a water quality issue. Following consultation with the Health Service Executive a boil water notice is being issued. Accordingly, in the interest of public health, it is recommended that all users on the Aughrim Annacurra water scheme boil water before use.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>A Boil Water Notice is being imposed with immediate effect.\u00a0<\/div><div>This notice affects all customers supplied by the Aughrim Annacurra PWS.\u00a0<\/div><div>A map of the affected areas, detailing properties affected, is available on www.water.ie.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>1: Water must be boiled (rolling boil for 1 minute and then cooled) for:<\/div><div>\u2022 Drinking<\/div><div>\u2022 Preparing Drinks made with water<\/div><div>\u2022 Preparation of salads and similar foods, which are not cooked prior to eating<\/div><div>\u2022 Brushing of teeth<\/div><div>\u2022 Making of ice<\/div><div>IMPORTANT: Boil water by bringing to a vigorous, rolling boil and allow to cool. Cover and store in a refrigerator or cold place. Water from the hot tap is not safe to drink.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>2: What can you use water for:<\/div><div>You can use your Water for the following:<\/div><div>- Personal hygiene, bathing and flushing of toilets but not for brushing teeth or gargling.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>3: Caution:<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Please ensure the following:<\/div><div>- Domestic water filters will not render water safe to drink.<\/div><div>- Caution should be taken when bathing children to ensure that they do not swallow the bathing water.<\/div><div>- Discard ice cubes in fridges and freezers and filtered water in fridges. Make ice from cooled boiled water.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>4: Only use Prepared Water (boiled and cooled) for the following situations.<\/div><div>- Use water prepared for drinking when preparing foods that will not be cooked (e.g. washing salads).<\/div><div>- Where a Boil Water Notice is in place, you can prepare infant formula from tap water that has been boiled once (rolling boil for 1 minute) and cooled beforehand. Bottled water can also be used to make up infant formula. All bottled water, with the exception of natural mineral water, is regulated to the same standard as drinking water. It is best not to use bottled water labelled as \u2018Natural Mineral Water\u2019 as it can have high levels of sodium (salt) and other minerals, although it rarely does. \u2018Natural Mineral Water\u2019 can be used if no other water is available, for as short a time as possible, as it is important to keep babies hydrated.<\/div><div>- If bottled water is used to make up infant formula it should be boiled once (rolling boil for 1 minute), and cooled in the normal way.<\/div><div>- Ready-to-use formula that does not need added water can also be used.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>5: Take Care:<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Care should be taken with boiled water to avoid burns and scalds as accidents can easily happen, especially with children.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>6: How long before the boil water notice can be lifted?<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>We do not know at present, but Irish Water and Wicklow County Council will continue to liaise with the Health Service Executive with a view to lifting the Boil Water Notice as soon as practicable. Irish Water and Wicklow County Council are working to resolve the issue and appreciate your patience during this time.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>7: How will we keep you informed?<\/div><div>You will be kept informed through the following media:<\/div><div>Website: www.water.ie\u00a0<\/div><div>Irish Water Customer Contact Centre: 1850 278 278<\/div><div>(IW registered vulnerable customers will be directly contacted)\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>8: Awareness for commercial premises<\/div><div>Irish water request that this Boil Water Notice is placed in a prominent position within your commercial premises\u00a0<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Remember to boil water as advised until further notice<\/div><div><br \/><\/div>",
